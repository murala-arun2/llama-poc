To analyze the call chain for `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName`, we'll start by identifying the callers of this method.

After reviewing the provided UML diagram, I found that `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName` is called by the following classes and methods:

1. **TagService**:
        * `getTags(search : String, type : Byte, pageIndex : int, pageSize : int)`: This method calls `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName`.
2. **StatusPageService**:
        * `queryComponentsStatus()`: This method calls `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName`.

Now, let's follow the call chain further:

1. From `TagService`:
        * Since `getTags` is a method of `TagService`, which implements `TagService` interface, and `deleteCollectorByName` is not an interface or abstract method in the provided UML diagram, it implies that `

`CollectorDao` class directly extends `CollectorDao` parent class.
2. From `StatusPageService`:
        * Similarly, since `queryComponentsStatus()` calls `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName`, which we already identified as being called by `TagService`, and considering the call chain from `TagService` to
`CollectorDao`, it implies that `StatusPageService` also directly extends or inherits from the same parent class of `CollectorDao`.

To further analyze, let's look at the callers of these classes:

1. **GlobalExceptionHandler**:
        * It calls various exception handling methods, but none of them call `CollectorDao::deleteCollectorByName`.
2. **Manager**:
        * The main method calls the `init()` method, which initializes all services and DAOs.

Based on this analysis, it appears that both `TagService` and `StatusPageService` classes directly extend or inherit from a common parent class of `CollectorDao`, which is likely `CollectorDAO` (assuming
`COLLECTOR_DAO` is the actual interface or parent class).

To clarify the relationships:

* `CollectorDAO` (interface or parent class) -> `CollectorDao`
* `TagService` implements `CollectorDAO` (or extends a common parent class that also implements/extends `CollectorDAO`)
* `StatusPageService` inherits from/extends the same parent class of `CollectorDao`

If you'd like to further investigate, I recommend reviewing the actual implementation code for these classes and interfaces to confirm the relationships and call chains.
