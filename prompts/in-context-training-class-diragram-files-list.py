- `PaymentService` can use either `CreditCardPayment` or `PayPalPayment` as the `paymentMethod` (because they both implement `PaymentMethod`).
- `PaymentService::processPayment()` invokes `processPayment()` on the selected `paymentMethod`, which either calls `CreditCardPayment::processPayment()` or `PayPalPayment::processPayment()`.

The flow for creating an order and processing payment depends on the user's role:

- `AdminUser` and `RegularUser` extend the `User` class, and both implement the `getRole()` method.
- The `Order::createOrder()` method checks the `role` of the user (either `AdminUser` or `RegularUser`).
- The payment method (`CreditCardPayment` or `PayPalPayment`) is selected based on the user’s role, and then `PaymentService::processPayment()` is invoked on the selected `paymentMethod`.
